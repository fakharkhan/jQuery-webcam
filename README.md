This plugin provides three different modes to access a webcam through a small API directly with JavaScript - or more precisely jQuery. Thus, it is possible to bring the image on a Canvas (callback mode), to store the image on the server (save mode) and to stream the live image of the Flash element on a Canvas (stream mode).
